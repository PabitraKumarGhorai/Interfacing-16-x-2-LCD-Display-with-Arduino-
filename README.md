# Interfacing-16-x-2-LCD-Display-with-Arduino-
16 x 2 LCD display is a basic &amp; commonly use display. It has 16 pins, to reduce pins you can use a I2C connector with display. I2C convert these 16 pins display into 4 pins.Out of these 4 pins,first pin is GND, second pin is VCC, third is SDA(Serial Data), Fourth pin is SCL(Serial CLock).
At first you need to download the library of I2C, then you need to download the I2C scaneer file.
After downloading you have to upload the I2C scaneer on your Arduino board, then you can find the I2C address of your display.
Then upload your main code.
